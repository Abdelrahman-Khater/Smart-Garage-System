# Smart-Garage-System

The project is a smart garage with an automated system that serves cars with the following
features:

1- Showing the free spots for the drivers before entering the garage.

2- Automated door:
    A) When cars approach the door from outside, the door opens only if there is at
       least one free spot.
    B) When cars approach the door from inside, the door opens.

3- Automated light system that controls the light inside the garage (light is on at night).

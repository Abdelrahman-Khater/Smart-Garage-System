# Smart Garage System

This is a project for the Digital System Design course Winter 2020 at the GUC.
The prototype represents a smart garage with an automated system that regulate the parking process with the following features:

1. Showing the free spots for the drivers before entering the garage.

2. Automated door:
   * When cars approach the door from outside, the door opens only if there is at
       least one free spot.
    
   * When cars approach the door from inside, the door opens.

3. Automated light system that controls the light inside the garage (light is on at night).
